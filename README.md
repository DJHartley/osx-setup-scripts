=======================

These scripts automate the installation of XCode and Command Line Tools on
a vanilla OS X machine running OS X 10.7 / 10.8.

To use these scripts, create a file named `config` in the script directory that
looks like so:

```bash
webserver="http://yourserver.com/pathtodirectorywithsoftware/"
```
